That’s when `boom.sh` became more than a joke — it became ✨ **self-defense** ✨.

`boom.sh` is a commit script designed to make your **GitHub profile look like you're dangerously productive**, even if you've spent the last year alternating between existential dread and Doomscrolling™.

It simulates a long, slow descent into madness via green squares.

Think of it like a fitness tracker — but instead of tracking your steps, it tracks your descent into full-stack fragility.

## 🤖 What it Actually Does

For the past **560 days**, this little monster:

- 🎯 **Commits between 1–20 times a day** using a _normal-ish distribution_ centered around 10 (because you’re “consistently crushing it”)
- 🎲 If it rolls a **20**, it rolls again and adds **1–7 bonus commits** (because overachieving is a curse)
- 🧨 **1% chance per day** to go full-on keyboard demon mode and commit **30–90 times**
- 🛌 Weekends? 30% chance of activity — because you're _trying_ to set boundaries
- 📈 Logs everything as if it were some sort of productivity journal... powered by delusion

---

## 🧪 Why?

Because:

- Burnout is free.
- Green squares = productivity, right?
- Recruiters don’t read your code. They read your commit heatmap like it's a horoscope.
- You’re tired of being ghosted by roles that require "entry-level unicorns with 8 years of TypeScript experience"

---

## 🛠 How to Use

```bash
chmod +x boom.sh
./boom.sh
```

Then push your glorious, overcommitted lies to GitHub:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/greenstorm.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
will probably need to up githubs buffer before pushing if it has a cry and fails

```bash
git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000
```

Boom. You now look like a developer who's legally required to touch grass.

## 💥 But Some of These Days Are Real

Yes — a lot of this is faked.  
But a **few of those monster commit days**?

Those were real.

Those were _“forgot to eat, haven’t blinked since 2am, frantically rearchitecting everything”_ kind of days.  
The _coding bender_ energy is alive and well.

## 📣 Message to Recruiters Looking at This

Hi 👋

If you're here because you're evaluating me for a role:

- Yes, this script is satirical.
- Yes, I ran it.
- No, not every commit is fake.
- Yes, I do actually write code.
- No, I don’t write 90 commits every Sunday (unless I’m emotionally unwell).

But if you're still here, laughing?  
We're gonna get along just fine. Now let’s talk about that job.

---

## 🧞‍♂️ Fun Ideas

- Add commit messages like “definitely not fake” or “burnout is a construct”
- Schedule this in a cron job so you can fake productivity while binge-watching anime
- Rename it to `not-a-bot.sh` for maximum irony
- Put it on a USB labeled “Do Not Open” and leave it at a tech meetup

```
When you're not coding, you're coding.
When you're sleeping, you're committing.
When you're job hunting, you're faking it.
